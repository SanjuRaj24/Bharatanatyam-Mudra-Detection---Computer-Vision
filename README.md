# Bharatnatyam Mudras Detection

## Project Overview

This project aims to detect and recognize Bharatanatyam mudras using computer vision and deep learning techniques. Bharat Natyam is a classical Indian dance form that involves intricate hand gestures known as "mudras." The system is designed to identify these mudras in real-time through a webcam or static images.

The project consists of four Python files and two folders, which will be generated by the program when you run it. Below is a brief description of each component:

### 1. `config.py`

This configuration file contains important variables and settings for the project. You can customize the following parameters in this file:

- **Model Path**: Specify the path where the trained model will be stored.
- **Dataset Path**: Set the path to the directory containing the dataset of mudras' images.
- **Mudras Names**: Define the names of the mudras to be recognized. Make sure they are in the same order as the corresponding folders in the dataset.
- **Input Image Shape**: Specify the input shape (e.g., width and height) of the images used for training and prediction.

### 2. `training.py`

This script is responsible for generating the training dataset and organizing it into folders named after each mudra. The process is automated and takes 100 images of the same mudra. To use this script, follow these steps:

1. Run the script.
2. It will open your computer's camera.
3. Display your hand and form the mudra you want to capture.
4. The script will start capturing pictures of your hand. Be sure to change the mudra's name every time you want to register a new mudra.

### 3. `generatingmodel.py`

This script is used to train the model using the training dataset generated by `training.py`. It will automatically detect the folder names inside the training dataset directory and train the model accordingly. Training the model can be resource-intensive and time-consuming, so ensure that your computer has sufficient RAM and close other tasks when initiating the training.

### 4. `gestures.py`

This is the main script for the Bharat Natyam mudras detection system. It loads the trained model and uses it to predict the mudras based on the input provided via a webcam or static images.

## Usage

To use this project:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries using
   > pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Configure the `config.py` file with the appropriate settings.
4. Generate the training dataset using `training.py`.
   > python `training.py`
5. Train the model using `generatingmodel.py`.
    > python `generatingmodel.py`
7. Run `gestures.py` to detect and recognize Bharat Natyam mudras in real-time.
   > python `gestures.py`

Please note that this project may require additional Python libraries and dependencies. Make sure to install them using `pip` if not already installed.
